    <i>"I have been playing music since I was a child. I used to sit with my keyboard and just play. I made my first song when I was 11 out of some basic chords and basic lyrics. It was called 'Little Things' and it was something about the little things that you never throw away."</i>

  <h3>On the meaning and process behind "Bittersweet"</h3> 

  <p><i>"The verses are very literal. That is about my relationship and how I needed to get out of it and get to know myself again. Then the chorus is a bit more like, metaphorical, using the analogy of being cleansed by the rain of a new season, that was perhaps me entering a new phase of my own life and making a big change and no matter how painful it was. That's where the bittersweet thing comes in: It was the right thing to do."</i>
