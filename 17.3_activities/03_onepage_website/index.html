            <p><p>Sir Wyatt was the last available parakeet in the land during the pandemic of 2020. We found him alone in his pet store cage barely two months old. His siblings had all found homes. The sqwaking of the nearby larger birds pierced the ears.</p>
            <p>A year later and he remains stubbornly standoffish with me. He holds a grudge I suppose, and I want to become his bestie. Where did I cross the line buddy? But tonight he perched next to me during my online class. We cooed softly to each other most of the time. I caught my image puckering to the side of my screen so retreated and tried wooing him ventriloquist style. He likes to take things slow. I want to nuzzle.</p>
