            <p><p>During the pandemic of 2020 there was a nation wide bird shortage. Sir Wyatt was the last to find a home. He was merely two months old and his siblings had been adopted. The shop was noisy and the sqwaking pierced our ears. We couldn't leave without him</p>
            <p>A year later he remains stubbornly standoffish with me although he's beginning to warm up. I want to become his bestie. Where did I cross the line buddy? He likes to take things slow and I want to nuzzle.</p>
            <p>Lately he perches next to me during my online class. We coo softly to each other. Sometimes he leans close, inquisitvely, seemingly whispering sweet nothings in my ear. When he's feeling quite brave or affectionate he'll swoop in to land on my head. He does a little foot dance and off he goes again.</p>
